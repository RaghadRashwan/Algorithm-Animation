# Algorithm-Animation
## Overview
This project developed an animated GUI to apply some algorithms median finding, randomized median finding and quick sort algorithms
## Functionalities:
### 1. calculating execution time of median finding 
  - Entering the size and the rank
  - applying quick sort algorithm to calculat the execution time
### 1. calculating execution time of randomized median finding 
    - Entering the size and the rank
    - applying quick sort algorithm to calculat the execution time
### 1. GUI
    - user interface to interact with the users
### 1. Animation
    - the result of the execution time will appear animated to the user
